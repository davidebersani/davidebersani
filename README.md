👋🏻 Hi! I'm Davide, a **Software Engineer** from Italy, who likes **building software** and **solve problems**... *actually, most of the time, build software for solving problems! (But there are also some exceptions (if you could see all my side projects and POC you would understand 😅)).*

🚀 I'm very interested in **software development** and **software architecture design**, and I like (try 😏) to do it in the right way.

🔭 I love to study new technologies, design patterns, philosophies, frameworks, and especially I love to experiment with them. 

💬 I also like to discuss about tech stuff, because I believe that the greatest teachings and ideas come from discussions and talks.

- 🔭 Every day I manage problems about orchestrate services and microservices, design API, design software architectures and play with technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, Python, Java, Serverless tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, Node.js and Go!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a Scout FSE and I love sport! Football, basket, padel, ping pong and I think any other kind of team sport 😄
